      Tim helps run [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au/), where the team has
      adopted dry-rb and [rom-rb](http://rom-rb.org/) for their prime Ruby web
      stack. Heâ€™s particularly interested in improving (and talking about!)
      high-level web app architecture in Ruby.

      Nikita has been programming in PL/SQL and Ruby for six years,
      he came to dry-rb through [rom-rb](http://rom-rb.org/). Whenever you see
      a really weird behavior, feel free to ask him for help.
